# Logical Nand

Write a function of type:
```ocaml
nand : bool -> bool -> bool
```
that implements the logical connective [nand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffer_stroke) ("not both").

Try with different implementation styles, using:
- the built-in logical connectives `not`, `&&`, `||`;
- conditional expressions;
- pattern matching.
